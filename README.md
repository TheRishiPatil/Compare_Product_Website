This is my 1st considerable project on java spring boot after learning this framework and working on a few smaller projects. It involves scraping data from popular websites like Flipkart, Amazon, Croma, and Jiomart. The backend is built using Java Spring Boot and MySQL, while the frontend is built using Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
